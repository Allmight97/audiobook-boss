# Implementation results and notes
Dev will add notes to this doc each phase in docs/planning/imp_plan.md is complete.

# Phase 1: Basic Tauri Commands and Backend-Frontend Connection - DONE
- These commands work as expected, after we fixed the TypeScript module loading issue.
    ```ts
    await window.testCommands.ping()
    await window.testCommands.echo('test')
    await window.testCommands.validateFiles(['/some/path.mp3'])
    ```
**NOTES:**
    - TypeScript module wasn't being loaded by the index.html. Adding <script type="module" src="/src/main.ts"></script>, fixed it.
    - Claude Code implemented Phase 1 correctly but failed to holistically consider updating index.html - API calls, parameter passing, and error handling were fine.
    - Consider concise updates to claude.md to encourage CC to think about the full user journey from UI to backend as each phase is implemented.
    TODO
        - [ ] Consider console helpers or UI buttons for testing.
        - [ ] What is best way to include google formatted code comments in this project?

# Phase 2: FFmpeg Integration
