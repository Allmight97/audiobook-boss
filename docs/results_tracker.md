# Implementation results and notes
Dev will add notes to this doc each phase in docs/planning/imp_plan.md is complete.

# Phase 1: Basic Tauri Commands and Backend-Frontend Connection - DONE
- These commands work as expected, after we fixed the TypeScript module loading issue.
    ```ts
    await window.testCommands.ping()
    await window.testCommands.echo('test')
    await window.testCommands.validateFiles(['/some/path.mp3'])
    ```
**NOTES:**
    - TypeScript module wasn't being loaded by the index.html. Adding <script type="module" src="/src/main.ts"></script>, fixed it.
    - Claude Code implemented Phase 1 correctly but failed to holistically consider updating index.html - API calls, parameter passing, and error handling were fine.
    - Consider concise updates to claude.md to encourage CC to think about the full user journey from UI to backend as each phase is implemented.
    TODO
        - [ ] Consider console helpers or UI buttons for testing.
        - [ ] What is best way to include google formatted code comments in this project?

# Phase 2: FFmpeg Integration - DONE
**VALIDATION:** Phase 2 was already complete but needed cleanup for AGENT.md compliance.

**IMPLEMENTED:**
- FFmpeg binary location logic (bundled → system PATH → common locations)
- FFmpeg command builder with version detection 
- Basic merge command for two files
- All requirements from imp_plan.md ✅

**CLEANUP COMPLETED:** 
- Created structured `AppError` type with Tauri integration
- Fixed command signatures: `Result<String,String>` → `Result<String>`  
- Refactored 80-line functions into ≤30 line helpers
- Removed all `unwrap()` calls with proper error handling
- Enabled `clippy::unwrap_used` enforcement

**TEST RESULTS:**
- ✅ 13 tests passing (added 3 new tests)
- ✅ Zero clippy warnings with strict lints
- ✅ FFmpeg version detection works
- ✅ File validation works
- ✅ Manual testing: Tauri dev launches successfully, UI functional

**NOTES:**
- Codebase now AGENT.md compliant and ready for Phase 3
- App designed for macOS .app packaging with bundled dependencies
- Foundation is solid for metadata handling and full audio processing

# Phase 3: Metadata Handling
