- **TIMELINE**: 3-4 weeks (after Plan A)
- **COMPLEXITY**: MEDIUM  
- **FOCUS**: cleanup.rs, context.rs, progress.rs, commands/mod.rs
- **OUTCOME**: All modules ≤400 lines, facade pattern applied consistently

---

## ✨ PLAN C: Quality Enhancement
📁 **[plan_c_quality_enhancement.md](plan_c_quality_enhancement.md)**
- **PURPOSE**: Final polish for production-ready codebase
- **TIMELINE**: 1-2 weeks (after Plan B)
- **COMPLEXITY**: LOW
- **FOCUS**: Function length, naming, documentation, developer tooling
- **OUTCOME**: Production-ready code quality, excellent developer experience

## 🧭 Navigation Patterns

### Sequential Reading (Recommended for New Users)
1. 📋 **[refactoring_roadmap_summary.md](refactoring_roadmap_summary.md)** - Overview & strategy
2. 📊 **[../audit_report_comprehensive.md](../audit_report_comprehensive.md)** - Current state analysis  
3. 🚨 **[plan_a_emergency_stabilization.md](plan_a_emergency_stabilization.md)** - Execute emergency fixes
4. 📋 **[plan_b_systematic_module_splitting.md](plan_b_systematic_module_splitting.md)** - Systematic improvements
5. ✨ **[plan_c_quality_enhancement.md](plan_c_quality_enhancement.md)** - Final polish

### Quick Reference (For Active Development)
- **Need strategy overview?** → [refactoring_roadmap_summary.md](refactoring_roadmap_summary.md)
- **Working on Plan A?** → [plan_a_emergency_stabilization.md](plan_a_emergency_stabilization.md)
- **Working on Plan B?** → [plan_b_systematic_module_splitting.md](plan_b_systematic_module_splitting.md)  
- **Working on Plan C?** → [plan_c_quality_enhancement.md](plan_c_quality_enhancement.md)
- **Need technical details?** → [../audit_report_comprehensive.md](../audit_report_comprehensive.md)

### Problem-Specific Navigation
- **Can't add audio features?** → Plan A emergency stabilization needed
- **Modules too large to navigate?** → Plan B systematic splitting needed  
- **Code quality not production-ready?** → Plan C enhancement needed
- **Don't know where to start?** → Read roadmap summary first

## 🎯 Decision Points

### Should I Start Refactoring?
- **YES** if you need to add audio processing features soon
- **YES** if the 1,455-line processor.rs is blocking development
- **NO** if you only need UI improvements (frontend work)

### Which Plan Should I Execute?
- **Plan A Only**: Need immediate feature development unblocked
- **Plans A + B**: Want sustainable development environment  
- **Plans A + B + C**: Want production-ready, team-ready codebase

### Am I Ready for Each Plan?
- **Plan A Ready**: Can commit 2-3 weeks, comfortable with git, basic Rust knowledge
- **Plan B Ready**: Plan A completed successfully, understand module patterns
- **Plan C Ready**: Plans A & B completed, want polish and long-term maintenance

## 🛡️ Safety Guidelines

### Before Starting Any Plan
1. **Create git branch** for the plan you're executing
2. **Run baseline tests**: `cd src-tauri && cargo test && cargo clippy -- -D warnings`
3. **Commit frequently** after each successful extraction
4. **Test after every change** - don't batch risky operations

### When to Stop and Ask for Help
- ❌ Tests start failing and you can't fix them quickly
- ❌ Clippy warnings appear and persist  
- ❌ UI behavior changes unexpectedly
- ❌ Code becomes more complex instead of simpler
- ❌ You feel overwhelmed by the extraction complexity

### Success Validation
- ✅ All tests passing: `cargo test --lib`
- ✅ Zero clippy warnings: `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`
- ✅ UI still works: `npm run tauri dev`
- ✅ Code is simpler/cleaner after changes

## 📚 Learning Resources

### For Junior Developers
- **Start with**: Roadmap summary for big picture understanding
- **Understand**: Audit report to see what needs fixing
- **Practice**: Plan A for hands-on refactoring experience
- **Master**: Plans B & C for systematic quality improvement

### For AI Assistants
- **Context**: Use audit report to understand current issues
