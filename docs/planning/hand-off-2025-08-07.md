### Hand-off: Refactor prep, tests, and safety baselining (2025-08-07)

#### What changed (high-level)
- Test hygiene:
  - Extracted inline tests to `src-tauri/tests/unit/**` for: `errors`, `audio/session`, `audio/metrics`, `metadata/{reader,writer}`, `ffmpeg/mod`, and `commands` (split into basic/audio/metadata).
  - Converted `unwrap/unwrap_err` usages in tests to `expect/expect_err` and fixed clippy format suggestions.
  - Moved `tests/audio/processor_tests.rs` → `tests/unit/audio/processor_tests.rs` and updated imports.
- Tooling:
  - Added `scripts/sg/size_budget.sh` to report modules >400 lines and heuristic functions >60 lines.
  - Added FFmpeg diagnostics: we now log the resolved FFmpeg binary path and a copy‑pasteable command preview before spawn.
- Planning docs:
  - `docs/planning/mvp-roadmap.md` (scope, criteria, milestones).
  - `docs/planning/refactor-plan.md` (test extraction, module split plan, FFmpeg boundary).
 - Processing boundary & reliability:
   - Introduced `MediaProcessor` trait and `ShellFFmpegProcessor`; routed execution via the trait (no behavior change).
   - Added best‑effort `wait()` after cancel kill‑polling to ensure child reaping (prevents zombies).
 - Packaging & runtime FFmpeg:
   - Configured Tauri `bundle.externalBin` to include `binaries/ffmpeg-universal` and updated `locate_ffmpeg()` to prefer the bundled binary; for dev, symlinked to Homebrew ffmpeg.
 - Progress UX:
   - Emitted proper stages after conversion: Finalizing → Writing Metadata → Completed (progress no longer stalls at 79%; cancel button no longer needed post‑completion).
- ffmpeg-next migration (P0 complete behind feature):
  - `FfmpegNextProcessor` implemented behind `safe-ffmpeg` feature: decode → resample → AAC encode → m4b mux; emits progress; honors cancel.
  - Feature-gated tests added at `src-tauri/tests/unit/audio/ffmpegnext_tests.rs` (uses repo media if present).
  - Selection wired by compile-time feature only; default remains shell.

#### Why these changes
- Establish clear test structure to support future refactors without regressions.
- Reduce clippy failures and improve test clarity (better failure messages via `expect`).
- Provide size visibility and a roadmap for progressively shrinking “godzilla” modules.

#### Current status (post-change snapshot)
- cargo test: green (default and `--features safe-ffmpeg` on macOS with Homebrew ffmpeg).
- cargo clippy: clean of unwrap errors; warnings limited to `dead_code` on scaffolding and a few stylistic lints.
- Size report (files >400 lines):
  - `src-tauri/src/audio/processor.rs` (631)
  - `src/ui/fileList.ts` (521)
  - `src-tauri/src/audio/progress.rs` (485)
  - `src-tauri/src/audio/cleanup.rs` (480)
  - `src/ui/statusPanel.ts` (443)
  - `src-tauri/tests/unit/audio/processor_tests.rs` (412) [test-only; OK]
  - `src-tauri/src/tests_integration.rs` (410)
 - E2E smoke: processing validated via Homebrew ffmpeg (libfdk_aac) using bundled path preference (dev symlink). Progress UI advances to completion.

#### Lingering code smells and risks
- Oversized modules: the five listed above; increase cognitive load and change risk.
- Inline tests still present in: `audio/{file_list.rs, progress.rs, settings.rs}`, `ffmpeg/command.rs` (depend on private APIs). Keep for now; move after defining testable boundaries.
- Dead code warnings: scaffolding types and builder methods not fully wired yet.
- FFmpeg shell command path building: concat list still interpolates paths (mitigated by `-safe 0` and stdin list). Centralized escaping helper still pending.

#### Recommendations (actionable next steps)
1) Finish test extraction (safe subset)
   - Promote minimal visibility for specific test targets via `pub(crate)` or small test adapters, then move tests for:
     - `audio/settings.rs` (validation functions)
     - `audio/progress.rs` (parser/report helpers)
     - `ffmpeg/command.rs` (parse_version; builder checks)
     - `audio/file_list.rs` (format validator)
   - Keep changes minimal; do not broaden API unnecessarily.

2) Introduce FFmpeg boundary (no behavior change)
   - Define trait `MediaProcessor` and implement `ShellFFmpegProcessor` wrapping existing command flow.
   - Wire `processor` to call through the trait. This unlocks later `ffmpeg-next` migration.

3) Module trimming (small, serial edits)
   - Deferred until after Safety/robustness and FFmpeg boundary (per current plan).
   - When resumed: `audio/progress.rs` → split into `progress/{reporter.rs, parser.rs}`; `audio/processor.rs` → `processor/{prepare.rs, execute.rs, finalize.rs}`; `commands/mod.rs` split by domain; UI TS files split into state/DOM/actions.

4) Safety/robustness quick wins
   - Add a shared `escape_ffmpeg_path(&str) -> String` and use in concat generation sites (`ffmpeg/command.rs::create_concat_list`, `audio/processor.rs::create_concat_file`).
   - Canonicalize paths and strip CR/LF/NUL via the shared helper (DONE). Full input path validation (exists/is_file/extension whitelist; canonicalize) will be implemented alongside the ffmpeg-next boundary.

5) Process reliability (backlog)
   - Progressive shutdown for ffmpeg child (TERM→KILL) in progress monitor.
   - RAII guards finalized across session/cleanup when boundary is introduced.

#### Junior-dev note: inline vs external tests in Rust
- Inline tests are common because they can access private items. External tests (in `tests/`) compile as a separate crate and see only public items.
- It’s fine to keep some inline tests while designing a public boundary. When you’re ready, make tiny `pub(crate)` adapters or elevate specific functions to move tests out.
- Production crates often keep some inline tests (unit-level) and add external tests for integration/black-box checks. You don’t have to remove inline tests for production.

#### Session wrap-up and next steps
- We halted further code changes at this point to avoid exceeding session context.
- Next session, proceed in this order:
  1. Implement `escape_ffmpeg_path` and path validation; apply in both concat sites.
  2. Introduce `MediaProcessor` trait and `ShellFFmpegProcessor`; route current processing via the trait (no behavior change).
  3. Add feature-gated `FfmpegNextProcessor` (stub/initial) without switching defaults.
  4. Re-run tests and clippy, update docs.
  5. Defer module trimming until after the above are merged and stable.

### UPDATE 2025-08-08 — P1 noise-reduction work (in-progress; paused)

This section appends a hand-off note for the feature-gating/Clippy cleanup work started after merging `gpt5-p0_ffmpegnext` into `pre_ffmpegnext`.

#### What was done
- Merge: `gpt5-p0_ffmpegnext` → `pre_ffmpegnext` (merge commit `f791f20`).
- FFmpeg resource: configured local Apple Silicon builds to pass default packaging checks via symlink and `npm run setup-ffmpeg`.
- Verified pre-P1 state: default and feature-on builds/tests green after merge.
- Began P1 “noise reduction” with the goals:
  - Default build (no features) clippy/test should be green with minimal noise.
  - Feature-on (`--features safe-ffmpeg`) clippy/test should also be green.
  - Avoid blanket `#[allow(dead_code)]`; prefer gating + tiny real usages.
- Edits attempted (in-progress):
  - Context:
    - `ProcessingContextBuilder`, `ProgressContext`, `ProgressContextBuilder` gated with `#[cfg(any(test, feature = "safe-ffmpeg"))]`.
    - `MediaProcessingPlan::execute_with_context` gated the same way.
    - `audio/mod.rs` re-exports adjusted so default build does not re-export gated items.
  - Cleanup:
    - `ProcessGuard` and helper methods partially gated; intent is to gate consistently or keep compiled with `cfg_attr(..., allow(dead_code))` until P2.
    - `CleanupGuard` helper methods left as-is; will either be exercised or `cfg_attr`-allowed in default until P2 removal.
  - Tests:
    - Added a tiny feature-on test usage for `ProgressContextBuilder` to avoid dead-code under `safe-ffmpeg`.
  - Clippy (feature-on only): added a temporary `#[allow(clippy::too_many_lines)]` to the `FfmpegNextProcessor` execute path. Will be refactored into helpers during P1.

#### Current status (paused on purpose)
- Default clippy/test: failing due to inconsistent gating of `ProcessGuard` (E0412 type not found) and dead_code hits on `CleanupGuard` helpers.
- Feature-on clippy/test: would fail on default gating mismatches and function length without the temporary allow.

#### Root-cause analysis (holistic / multidimensional)
- Ownership and module boundaries:
  - Types like `ProcessGuard` and `ProgressContext*` are re-exported from `audio/mod.rs`. Gating at type level but not matching at re-exports/impls creates “type not found” under default.
  - Some helper methods are designed for integration yet not called in the default path; with `-D warnings`, this surfaces as dead_code noise.
- Build matrices coupling:
  - We must keep both matrices (default, feature-on) clippy-clean simultaneously. Small cfg drifts (export vs. impl vs. use-site) cause asymmetries.
- Testing vs. availability:
  - Builders that are only used in tests need either consistent gating (`any(test, feature)`) or a tiny real usage. Otherwise, dead_code toggles across matrices.
- Static analysis strictness:
  - `clippy::too_many_lines` is useful but forces earlier refactoring of the ffmpegnext execute path or a temporary allow.
- Process:
  - Editing multiple files iteratively led to drift. Safer is a single, consistent policy per type (either fully gate or keep compiled with `cfg_attr(..., allow(dead_code))`).

#### Decision points (recommended)
- For P1 (minimize noise, avoid churn):
  1) Choose ONE policy per type:
     - Option A (simpler now): keep `ProcessGuard`, `ProgressContext*`, and `ProcessingContextBuilder` compiled in default with:
       `#[cfg_attr(not(any(test, feature = "safe-ffmpeg")), allow(dead_code))]`
       Then remove these allows in P2.
     - Option B (stricter gating): fully gate these types and all impl blocks and re-exports behind `#[cfg(any(test, feature = "safe-ffmpeg"))]` and ensure default never references them. This requires auditing all exports and impls and may be a bit more invasive.
  2) Keep `#[allow(clippy::too_many_lines)]` only on the feature-on execute impl; schedule a refactor in P1 to split it into small helpers (<60 lines each per coding guidelines).
  3) Add a tiny feature-on test that exercises the context/cleanup scaffolding if kept compiled; otherwise ensure gating is consistent across re-exports and impls.

#### Concrete next steps (actionable)
- Short-term (P1‑now):
  - Adopt Option A for speed and safety:
    - Add `cfg_attr` dead_code allows to: `ProcessGuard`, `ProgressContext`, `ProgressContextBuilder`, `ProcessingContextBuilder`, and `CleanupGuard` helper methods that are unused in default matrix.
    - Ensure re-exports in `audio/mod.rs` match availability; export builders and `ProcessGuard` only under `#[cfg(any(test, feature = "safe-ffmpeg"))]`.
    - Keep the temporary `too_many_lines` allow under feature-on only.
  - Verify both matrices:
    - Default: `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`, `cargo test`.
    - Feature-on: `cargo clippy --features safe-ffmpeg -- -D warnings`, `cargo test --features safe-ffmpeg`.
- Medium (P1‑refactor):
  - Split the ffmpegnext execute function into helpers to remove the `too_many_lines` allow.
  - Replace transitional allows by converting “dead” helpers into used ones or gating them away.
- P2 (cleanup):
  - Remove legacy shell-only adapters and any scaffolding not required by the default engine.
  - Delete all `cfg_attr(..., allow(dead_code))` introduced in P1 and keep CI failing if any remain outside tests.

#### CI plan (to enforce end-state)
- Add two Clippy jobs (both fail on warnings):
  - Default: `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`
  - Feature-on: `cargo clippy --features safe-ffmpeg -- -D warnings`
- Add a P2-phase guard that fails builds if `allow(dead_code)` appears outside `tests/`.

#### Ask / hand-off
- Paused intentionally to avoid deepening the gating drift. Next implement the Option‑A `cfg_attr` policy consistently, then refactor the ffmpegnext execute path into helpers to drop the temporary allow during P1.

#### Consolidated plan (canonical)
  - Detailed migration steps here: docs/planning/ffmpeg-next-migration.md
- Pre-ffmpeg-next
  - [X] Shared `escape_ffmpeg_path` implemented and used in all concat sites — DONE
  - [X] Introduce `MediaProcessor` trait and `ShellFFmpegProcessor`; route current processing via the trait (no behavior change) — DONE
  - [X] Ensure child reaping after cancel: after `kill()` polling, call best‑effort `wait()` — DONE
  - [X] Prefer bundled FFmpeg for releases — Configured `externalBin` and runtime preference; dev uses symlink to Homebrew. (Optional checksum verification remains P1 backlog.)
- Post-ffmpeg-next
  - [X] Feature flag scaffold (`safe-ffmpeg`) and a non-default `FfmpegNextProcessor` implementation — BOOTSTRAPPED (skeleton; not default)
  - [ ] Gradually migrate off concat files; retire `escape_ffmpeg_path` once not needed
  - [ ] Maintain input path validation (exists, is regular file, extension whitelist); canonicalize; define symlink/base-dir/base-path policy as needed
  - [ ] Optional: write-permission probe for output directory
  - [ ] Tests green and clippy clean (minus known dead_code scaffolding); docs refreshed to reflect changes
