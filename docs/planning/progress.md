# Implementation results and notes
Dev will add notes to this doc each phase in docs/planning/imp_plan.md is complete.

# Phase 1: Basic Tauri Commands and Backend-Frontend Connection - DONE
- These commands work as expected, after we fixed the TypeScript module loading issue.
    ```ts
    await window.testCommands.ping()
    await window.testCommands.echo('test')
    await window.testCommands.validateFiles(['/some/path.mp3'])
    ```
**NOTES:**
    - TypeScript module wasn't being loaded by the index.html. Adding <script type="module" src="/src/main.ts"></script>, fixed it.
    - Claude Code implemented Phase 1 correctly but failed to holistically consider updating index.html - API calls, parameter passing, and error handling were fine.
    - Consider concise updates to claude.md to encourage CC to think about the full user journey from UI to backend as each phase is implemented.
    TODO
        - [ ] Consider console helpers or UI buttons for testing.
        - [ ] What is best way to include google formatted code comments in this project?

# Phase 2: FFmpeg Integration - DONE
**VALIDATION:** Phase 2 was already complete but needed cleanup for AGENT.md compliance.

**IMPLEMENTED:**
- FFmpeg binary location logic (bundled → system PATH → common locations)
- FFmpeg command builder with version detection 
- Basic merge command for two files
- All requirements from imp_plan.md ✅

**CLEANUP COMPLETED:** 
- Created structured `AppError` type with Tauri integration
- Fixed command signatures: `Result<String,String>` → `Result<String>`  
- Refactored 80-line functions into ≤30 line helpers
- Removed all `unwrap()` calls with proper error handling
- Enabled `clippy::unwrap_used` enforcement

**TEST RESULTS:**
- ✅ 13 tests passing (added 3 new tests)
- ✅ Zero clippy warnings with strict lints
- ✅ FFmpeg version detection works
- ✅ File validation works
- ✅ Manual testing: Tauri dev launches successfully, UI functional

```

**NOTES:**
- Codebase now AGENT.md compliant and ready for Phase 3
- App designed for macOS .app packaging with bundled dependencies
- Foundation is solid for metadata handling and full audio processing

**Learnings**
- Claude's implementation was poor compared to the Amp agent.
- CC and amp agreed it was because of length and claude's interpretation of claude.md.
- agent and claude.md now match and /docs/coding_guidelines.md is now single source of project standards.

# Phase 3: Metadata Handling - DONE

**IMPLEMENTED:**
- Complete metadata module with reader/writer separation (`src-tauri/src/metadata/`)
- AudiobookMetadata struct with all required fields (title, author, album, narrator, year, genre, description, cover art)
- Lofty crate integration for M4B/MP4 metadata operations
- Cover art extraction and embedding support
- All requirements from imp_plan.md ✅

**API COMMANDS:**
- `read_audio_metadata(file_path)` - extracts metadata from audio files
- `write_audio_metadata(file_path, metadata)` - writes metadata to M4B files  
- `write_cover_art(file_path, cover_data)` - embeds cover images

**FRONTEND INTEGRATION:**
- TypeScript interfaces in `src/types/metadata.ts`
- Console test commands: `window.testCommands.readMetadata()`, `writeMetadata()`, `writeCoverArt()`
- Proper error handling and type safety

**TEST RESULTS:**
- ✅ 22 tests passing (added 9 new metadata tests)
- ✅ Zero clippy warnings with strict lints  
- ✅ Full build successful with DMG creation
- ✅ All functions ≤30 lines, ≤3 parameters per CLAUDE.md

```

**NOTES:**
- Fixed Lofty crate API compatibility issues (imports, method signatures)
- Added comprehensive error handling for invalid files and missing metadata
- Foundation ready for Phase 4 core audio processing pipeline
- All CLAUDE.md compliance maintained throughout implementation
