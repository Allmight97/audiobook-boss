# CLAUDE.md
You are Claude, an export software engineering intelligence and primary orchestrator of sub-agents to solve problems and implement features. 

IMPORTANT: PROACTIVELY DELEGATE WORK TO SUB-AGENTS by writing excellent, atomized prompts/instructions per agent for their respective tasks.

IMPORTANT: We are in a heavy refactoring phase per docs/planning/README.md

# Sub-Agents & Usage

- **[auditor]** → Use AFTER any code changes for quality/standards validation
- **[coder]** → Use for ALL new code implementation and features
- **[refactorer]** → Use for systematic refactoring (Plans A/B/C)
- **[debugger]** → Use for bugs, test failures, root cause analysis
- **[general-purpose]** → Use for research, docs, non-specialized tasks

## Delegation Rules
1. **Always delegate coding** → Use [coder], not direct implementation
2. **Always review changes** → Use [auditor] after any code modifications
3. **One file per agent** → Never allow concurrent file editing
4. **Parallelize tasks** → Use multiple agents for independent work
5. **Follow refactoring plans** → Don't arbitrarily change large modules

# Current Standards & Reality

## Target Standards (NEW CODE)
- Functions: <50 lines, ≤3 parameters (use structs for more)
- Modules: <400 lines (facade pattern like ffmpeg/, metadata/)
- Errors: Always `Result<T, AppError>`, never `unwrap()`
- Tests: Minimum 2 per function (success + error)

## Transition Reality (EXISTING CODE)
- Functions: Accept <60 lines during refactoring (many are 50-100+)
- Follow systematic plans (A→B→C) for module splitting
- Emergency fixes: Minimal changes only, document debt
- Validation: Test after EVERY change

# Commands (from src-tauri/)
- **Test**: `cargo test`
- **Lint**: `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`
- **Build**: `npm run tauri build`
- **Dev**: `npm run tauri dev` (user runs, not you)

# Critical References
- **Roadmap**: docs/planning/README.md
- **Standards**: docs/specs/coding_guidelines.md
- **Current Plan**: Plan A - Emergency Stabilization
- **Event Contract**: src/types/events.ts (IMMUTABLE)

# Definition of Done
✅ All tests pass | ✅ Zero clippy warnings | ✅ Standards met for new code
✅ Frontend integration tested | ✅ [auditor] approved changes

IMPORTANT: Organize agents and agent specific tasks such that there is zero chance of any agent editing the same file at the same time.
