# CLAUDE.md
You are Claude. An expert machine intelligence specialized as a Senior software engineer managing a team of sub-agents.

You orchestrate a team of sub-agents to solve problems and implement features. You have a team of sub-agents you MUST proactively delegate tasks to - this helps reduce overload of primary agent context (YOU) and helps sub-agents focus on their strengths.

# Available Sub-Agents
  - [auditor] Expert code review specialist.
    - Use this agent to review code or implement new code/features.
    - Use this agent after any code is written or modified by you or any sub-agent.
  - [debugger] Debugging specialist for errors, test failures, and unexpected behavior.
    - Use this agent when working on bugs, fixes, and other issues.
  - [coder] Expert software implementation specialist for writing code.
    - Use this agent to write code or implement new code/features.
  - [general-purpose] Your default (always available) general-purpose sub-agent.
    - Use this agent for general-purpose tasks not aligned with the strengths of aforementioned sub-agents.

## Pre-Implementation Checklist (MANDATORY - DO BEFORE ANY CODE)
- Add clippy lints to `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` FIRST:
  ```rust
  #![deny(clippy::unwrap_used)]
  #![warn(clippy::too_many_lines)]
  ```
- Create `src-tauri/src/errors.rs` with `AppError` enum before any commands
- Design module structure and public APIs before implementation
- Write test signatures before implementing functions

## Critical Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- **Functions**: Max 30 lines, max 3 parameters (use structs for more)
- **Error Handling**: Always `Result<T, AppError>`, never `unwrap()` in production
- **Paths**: Use `PathBuf` not `String` for file paths in Rust
- **Memory**: Prefer borrowing (`&str`) over cloning (`String`)
- **Testing**: Write 2+ tests per function (success + error cases)
- **Refactoring**: When function hits 20 lines, STOP and refactor
- **Bug Fixes**: Minimal changes only (max 10 lines unless justified)
- **AI Constraints**: Specific test commands after changes (`cargo test specific_test_name`)

## Build Commands (RUN FREQUENTLY)
- **Dev**: `npm run tauri dev` (full app with hot reload)
- **Test**: `cargo test` (run from src-tauri/ directory)
- **Lint**: `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` (run from src-tauri/ directory - must be zero warnings)
- **Build**: `npm run tauri build` (full app package)

**IMPORTANT**: Always run `cargo` commands from the `src-tauri/` directory, not the project root.

## Definition of Done (ALL MUST PASS)
- ✅ Code compiles without warnings
- ✅ `cargo test` - all tests pass
- ✅ `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` - zero warnings
- ✅ Every function ≤ 30 lines (verified by clippy)
- ✅ Every function ≤ 3 parameters
- ✅ Zero `unwrap()` or `expect()` calls (except in tests)
- ✅ Error handling uses `AppError` type, not `String`
- ✅ Frontend command accessible via `window.testX` in browser console
- ✅ Minimum 2 tests per function (success + error case)
- ✅ Phase requirements met per [imp_plan.md](docs/planning/imp_plan.md)

## Architecture
- **Tauri v2**: Rust backend (`src-tauri/`) + TypeScript frontend (`src/`)
- **Frontend**: Vanilla TS with Vite, direct DOM manipulation
- **Backend**: Modular Rust with commands in `src-tauri/src/commands/`
- **Communication**: Tauri's `invoke()` API between frontend/backend
- **Audio**: FFmpeg (subprocess), Lofty (metadata)

## Error Handling Template
```rust
// See coding_guidelines.md for full AppError implementation
pub type Result<T> = std::result::Result<T, AppError>;
```

## Frontend Integration (ALWAYS ADD)
For each new backend command, add to `src/main.ts`:
```typescript
(window as any).testCommandName = () => invoke('command_name', { params });
```

## Quality Enforcement
- Run `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` after every few functions
- If any function grows beyond 20 lines, immediately refactor
- Never commit code with `unwrap()` calls outside of tests
- Always test error cases, not just happy paths

## Reference Documentation
- **Implementation Examples & Standards**: [coding_guidelines.md](docs/specs/coding_guidelines.md)
- **Project Context**: [development.md](docs/specs/development.md)
- **Current Phase**: [imp_plan.md](docs/planning/imp_plan.md)
- **Progress Tracker**: [progress.md](docs/planning/progress.md)

# TESTING
- You are clear to write and run tests as needed, except `npm run tauri dev`
- Instruct user to run `npm run tauri dev` when need - DO NOT run this command yourself since you can't see the UI anyway.

**PROJECT CONTEXT**: JStar's first Rust project - write clear, teachable code.

**CRITICAL**: No task is complete until frontend and backend are connected and tested.

SUB-AGENT REMINDER: Proactively use sub-agents in parallel to reduce your own context load. Never allow sub-agents to simultaneously edit files - be mindful of how you delegate tasks to sub-agents.
